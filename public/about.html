<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I add value to brands through design. These creative graphic designs have helped increase clientsâ€™ transactions. 
  I am result oriented and I seek to apply disciplined knowledge gained from years of consistent practice, 
  work and personal attributes of enthusiasm into your organization.</p>

<p>I have an eye for aesthetics. I leverage basic Adobe tools (photoshop, illustrator, after effects, premiere pro)
  and other industry-standard tools.</p>

<p>My core skills are designs of marketing programs (logos, flyers, brochures, corporate identity, branding, web banners,
  newsletters, info graphics, presentations, advertisements and digital media marketing).</p>
